# Wall-E Movie analysis

AI in WALL-E: Describe the role of AI in the movie WALL-E. How are AI systems like WALL-E and AUTO depicted in the film? How do they interact with humans, and what functions do they serve in the story?

The role of A.I like Wall-E is the aftercare of a self-serving robot mainly because he's all alone on earth, yet he's still so kind and thoughtful when it comes to any lifeform he comes across. Wall-e interacts with humans in a odd way considering his first time seeing them is also under odd circumstances as well since first meeting a human he was actually really kind and helped the human in a way that probably wouldn't have.
