You know lately ive been thinking a lot about how people see the world. Perspectives and opinions and things of that nature and the world as people see it, sometimes it can be overwhelming how society can judje you based off what you feel like it right to you. From birth we are all forced to follow these certain morals, which is fine, its very reasonable to whats right and wrong usually in this world, but once you get older you start to see the world for what it really is, how cruel it can be.
