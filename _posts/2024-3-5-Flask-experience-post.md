# My experience with Flask
---
**Introduction**

Flask is a python module that's used to develop web applications. It's used in so many ways to help with coding with html as well. Flask can also be known as a web Framework, what that means is that it's a whole bunch of libraries and modules that all work together to make developing web applications much easier.

## HTML/CSS vs Flask
What would make flask different from HTML and CSS you may ask? Well to start off HTML and CSS are still great at developing web applications and such of that sort, but in web development there are two parts to a project. The front end part which is the UI, the theme, the navbars, buttons, etc. What you would usually use for code would be html and css since both of those are the easiest to start out with then web developing. But then there's also back end, in which it focuses more on usually everything you can't physically see on the website, how everything should work behind the scenes of a website, which is where python comes into play, in which flask is used all around in python to help developers develop the back end of there website.

# Languages?
From what I heard since using flask you can't really use any other language other than Python since Flask is built into Python, though I am sure that other HTML languages have the same type of module that is similar to flask.

**Resources**

**Learning Flask**  -
While first learning Flask I had to learn and install a couple things as well. To use flask the way we wanted, which was in a website creating type way, we had to download the jinja template. Now jinja is a whole other thing where it lets the developers import Python code in a HTML template. Since Python and HTML are two different coding languages it wouldn't normally work either way in the same file without jinja. There's also a module that helped in making the code work which was pymysql, it lets us use SQL, Structured Query Language, to let us execute certain things we would want to do with the database. SQL is basically a language that communicates with databases, because database's can be so complex you would need to learn that language to be able to execute certain things. If you want to pull, edit, add information to your data you would use SQL to do so. Another thing we needed to use as a resource would be Kanban and Kanban is used for project management and we used it to manage our progress in our project. For example managing things like creating a repository for the website, creating a landing page for the website as well, creating a database, etc. The database was a step I had to set up beforehand for this stuff to work. The database, meaning the information of customers, users, etc that interact with our website. The database is a big part of my project but before I could create a database, I had to create an ER Diagram, an Entity Relationship Diagram, which is used to design relational databases. We used these to help us with the making of the database so that we wouldn't go in blindly.

## Challenges and Learning
There were a ton of challenges while trying to create the website, but I feel like ones that are most noticeable would be implementing the database that I had created for my website, and then making it a relational database, using a Foreign key. A foreign key is a key that connects to another table in the database, it's the key part to making everything in the database connect to each other. Another challenge would be learning SQL, because again its a certain language to use when dealing with databases, the thing is with SQL though is that it's not like normal coding, they supposedly made it easier to understand as a language for databases, but even sometimes it was still hard implement SQL into my code mainly because at times it just wouldn't work since you have to so discreetly precise with SQL.

**Overcoming the challenges**

Even though I had troubles with coding SQL into my project and connecting the databases using the foreign key, what made me overcome those challenges would be just practicing and using the advice of my project manager to help me through these type of steps. With the database problem I had to really think about which piece of data connects to each other and knowing how to put that into the database, because working with databases isn't easy of course. But then at the End the tables in the database  looked specifically ordered in the way they are supposed to be connected, and I say this because if the foreign keys don't match the other tables in the database the whole thing looks wrong, and you can physically see that it's wrong. And the way I covered the challenge of SQL would be something called the opeing task I would have while learning SQL, every morning we would start off with a task to refresh our brains of what we learned the day before and it would be based off of different things we learned throughout the week or month as well, but it also mainly helped me with my SQL problem.

## The project
What I tried to create was a social media website that has a landing page, a whole login type of setup, using the database where you can actually put it an email and it would be sent to the database. A user post feed, where the user would be able to post there something and it would have likes, a description, and a timestamp. Though I would not be able to finish this project because some parts of the project I couldn't understand since it was a lot of stuff needed to be able to do the coding you want to do. One thing I learned from this project is how fascinating a social media website is, and how much time and effort it takes just to create one. It made me appreciate web developers more because of that project.
